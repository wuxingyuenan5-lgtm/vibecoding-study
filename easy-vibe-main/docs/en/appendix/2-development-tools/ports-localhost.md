# Ports and localhost

> 💡 **Learning Guide**: When you run `npm run dev` and the terminal shows `http://localhost:5173`, have you ever wondered: what is `localhost`? What does `5173` represent? Why do you sometimes get an `EADDRINUSE` error? This chapter will thoroughly explain these concepts you see every day in development but rarely dig into.

Before we begin, it's recommended to brush up on two foundational topics:

- **Networking basics**: If you're not clear on IP addresses and HTTP concepts, check out [Computer Fundamentals - Network Communication](../1-computer-fundamentals/network-fundamentals.md).
- **Terminal basics**: If you're not familiar with the command line terminal, check out [Command Line & Shell Scripts](./command-line-shell.md).

## 0. Introduction: What Exactly Is That `localhost:5173` You See Every Day?

<DevServerFlowDemo />

Every developer's daily routine includes this line of output:

```
➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

But have you ever thought about how many key concepts are packed into this short line:

- **http://** → The communication protocol (what language to speak)
- **localhost** → The target address (who to find)
- **:5173** → The port number (which door to knock on after finding the address)

Understand these three things, and you'll be able to figure out 90% of development environment networking issues. Let's break them down one by one.

## 1. What Is a Port? (IP Is the Building, Port Is the Room Number)

### 1.1 An Intuitive Analogy

Imagine a server is a building:

- An **IP address** (e.g., `192.168.1.100`) is the building's street address — it tells you "which building to go to."
- A **port number** (e.g., `:80`) is the room number inside the building — it tells you "which room to enter."

A building can simultaneously have a restaurant (room 80), a cafe (room 443), and an office (room 22). Similarly, a single computer can run a web server, a database, and an SSH service simultaneously, each using a different port.

👇 **Try it out**:
Click the "room numbers" below to simulate connecting to different ports. Notice what happens when a port is "open" (a program is listening) versus "closed."

<PortAnalogyDemo />

### 1.2 Port Number Ranges

A port number is an integer between **0–65535** (65,536 total). These ports are divided into three ranges:

| Range | Values | Purpose | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **System Ports** | 0 – 1023 | Reserved for standard protocols; ordinary users can't freely use them | 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), 22 (SSH) |
| **Registered Ports** | 1024 – 49151 | Registered for common applications | 3306 (MySQL), 5432 (PostgreSQL), 6379 (Redis) |
| **Dynamic Ports** | 49152 – 65535 | Temporarily assigned by the operating system | When a browser makes a request, the OS randomly assigns a source port |

> Why does your dev server like to use 3000, 5173, or 8080? Because they're all in the "registered ports" range — no admin privileges needed to listen on them, and they're less likely to conflict with system services.

## 2. What Is localhost? (Finding Yourself)

### 2.1 The Core Concept of "Loopback"

`localhost` is a special domain name that always points to **your own computer**.

When you type `http://localhost:3000` in your browser, here's what happens:

1. The browser asks the OS: "What's the IP for `localhost`?"
2. The OS answers directly: "`127.0.0.1`" (no need to look up DNS over the network)
3. The packet is sent to `127.0.0.1`, but **never actually leaves your machine**
4. The OS "loops back" the packet through the **loopback interface**
5. The program listening on port 3000 receives the request and sends a response

**The entire process doesn't go through any network cable, router, or internet connection.**

👇 **Try it out**:
Click "Send Request" to observe the complete journey of a data packet. Then click the "alias cards" below to learn about the different ways to write localhost and their differences.

### 2.2 `localhost` vs `127.0.0.1` vs `0.0.0.0`

These three concepts are often confused, but they mean entirely different things:

| Notation | Meaning | Who Can Access |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `localhost` / `127.0.0.1` | Loopback address, local machine only | Only your own computer |
| `0.0.0.0` | Listen on all network interfaces | Local machine + other devices on the LAN |
| `192.168.x.x` | LAN IP | Devices on the local network |

**Practical scenarios**:

```bash
# Only you can access (secure, good for development)
npm run dev -- --host localhost

# Your phone can also access (good for mobile debugging)
npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0
```

> Many frameworks (like Vite, Next.js) listen on `localhost` by default, so even if your phone is on the same WiFi, it can't access your dev server. Want to debug on mobile? Just add the `--host` flag.

## 3. Port Conflicts: The Most Common Dev Environment Issue

### 3.1 Why Do Conflicts Happen?

**One port can only be listened on by one program at a time.** It's like one room can only house one family.

If you try to start a second service on the same port, you'll see this classic error:

```
Error: listen EADDRINUSE :::3000
```

In plain English: **"Room 3000 is already occupied — you can't get in!"**

Common conflict scenarios:
- The previous dev server wasn't properly shut down and is still running in the background
- Two different projects use the same default port
- Some system service has already taken the port you want

👇 **Try it out**:
Try starting services multiple times in the simulator below. When a port conflict occurs, compare how "direct start" and "smart start" handle it differently.

<PortConflictDemo />

### 3.2 Troubleshooting and Resolution

When you encounter a port conflict, the troubleshooting steps are very consistent:

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
# Step 1: Check who is using port 3000
lsof -i :3000

# Step 2: Once you have the PID, force kill it
kill -9 <PID>
```

**Windows:**
```bash
# Step 1: Check who is using port 3000
netstat -ano | findstr :3000

# Step 2: Kill the process
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```

> Many modern frameworks (Vite, Create React App, etc.) will automatically ask "switch to another port?" when they detect a conflict. But understanding the underlying principles helps you troubleshoot those tricky issues that frameworks can't handle.

## 4. Same-Origin Policy and CORS in Development

### 4.1 What Is an "Origin"?

Browsers have a security mechanism called the **Same-Origin Policy**: only when the **protocol, domain, and port** are all identical, are two URLs considered the "same origin."

| URL A | URL B | Same Origin? | Reason |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `http://localhost:5173` | `http://localhost:5173/about` | ✅ Same origin | Protocol, domain, port are all the same |
| `http://localhost:5173` | `http://localhost:3000` | ❌ Different origin | **Different ports** (5173 vs 3000) |
| `http://localhost:5173` | `https://localhost:5173` | ❌ Different origin | **Different protocols** (http vs https) |

### 4.2 Why Does Frontend-Backend Separation Always Encounter CORS?

When your project architecture is:

```
Frontend (Vite)  →  http://localhost:5173
Backend (Express) →  http://localhost:3000
```

The frontend page loads from `:5173`, then uses `fetch('/api/users')` to request the API on `:3000` — **different ports trigger the cross-origin restriction!**

**Two common solutions:**

**Option 1: Configure CORS on the backend**
```javascript
// Express backend
app.use(cors({ origin: 'http://localhost:5173' }))
```

**Option 2: Configure a proxy on the frontend (recommended)**
```javascript
// vite.config.js
export default {
  server: {
    proxy: {
      '/api': 'http://localhost:3000'
    }
  }
}
```

How the proxy works: The Vite dev server "forwards" requests on your behalf. The browser thinks it's communicating with `:5173` (same origin), while Vite secretly relays the requests to `:3000` behind the scenes.

## 6. Terminology Reference

| English Term | Chinese Translation | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Port** | 端口 | A number from 0–65535 used to distinguish different network services on the same machine. Each service "listens" on a port, waiting for client connections. |
| **localhost** | 本地主机 | A special domain name that always points to the local machine (127.0.0.1). Used to access services running on your own machine without an internet connection. |
| **Loopback Interface** | 环回接口 | A virtual network interface in the operating system. Packets sent to 127.0.0.1 never leave the machine; they are "looped back" through this interface. |
| **EADDRINUSE** | 地址已被使用 | An error from Node.js / the OS indicating the port you want to listen on is already occupied by another program. |
| **CORS** | 跨域资源共享 | A browser security mechanism. When a frontend page tries to request an API from a different origin (different protocol/domain/port), the backend must explicitly grant permission. |
| **Same-Origin Policy** | 同源策略 | The cornerstone of browser security: only allows free communication between requests with the same protocol, domain, and port, blocking cross-origin data reads. |
| **Proxy** | 代理 | In a dev environment, a proxy server forwards requests from the browser to the backend, bypassing the browser's same-origin restriction. |
| **0.0.0.0** | 所有接口 | When a service listens on 0.0.0.0, it accepts connections from any network interface (local machine, LAN, etc.). |
| **Well-known Ports** | 知名端口 | The collective name for ports 0–1023, reserved for standard protocols like HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), SSH (22). |
| **PID** | 进程 ID | A unique number assigned by the OS to each running program, used to manage and terminate processes. |
| **lsof** | 列出打开的文件 | A macOS/Linux command used to see which process is using a specific port (`lsof -i :port_number`). |
| **HMR** | 热模块替换 | A dev server feature: when you modify code, the browser updates automatically without manual refresh. Works via WebSocket notifications under the hood. |

## Summary

Ports and localhost are the most fundamental, most frequently encountered concepts in the development environment:

- **Port** = A "room number" distinguishing different services on a machine (0–65535)
- **localhost** = The special "find yourself" address (127.0.0.1), data never leaves your machine
- **Port conflict** is essentially "one room number can only have one sign"
- **CORS** is essentially "different ports = different origins," requiring CORS or a proxy to resolve

Remember these four points, and you'll be able to quickly identify the cause of most networking issues in your development environment.
