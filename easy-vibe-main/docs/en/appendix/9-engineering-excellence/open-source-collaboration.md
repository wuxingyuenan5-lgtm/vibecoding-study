## 0. The Big Picture: The Value of Open Source

Open source is more than code sharing — it's a **global collaboration model**. Linux, React, Vue, Node.js — these world-changing projects are all open source.

::: tip Benefits of Participating in Open Source
- **Technical Growth**: Read excellent code, receive expert reviews
- **Career Development**: Open source contributions are the best technical calling card
- **Community Belonging**: Become a member of the global developer community
- **Giving Back**: The tools you use every day need people to maintain them

## 1. Open Source Contribution Process

Use the interactive component below to step through the complete process from Fork to Merge:

<OpenSourceWorkflowDemo />

### 1.1 Process Overview

```
Fork → Clone → Branch → Commit → Push → PR → Review → Merge
```

### 1.2 Key Steps in Detail

**Create a feature branch**: Never develop directly on main.

```bash
git checkout -b fix/typo-in-readme
```

**Write clear commit messages**: Follow the project's commit conventions.

```bash
git commit -m "fix: correct typo in README install command"
```

**Create a Pull Request**: The PR description should include:
- What changed and why
- Related issue number (e.g., `Fixes #123`)
- How to test your changes

## 2. Open Source Licenses

Use the interactive component below to compare common open source licenses:

<LicenseComparisonDemo />

### 2.1 Common Licenses

| License | Characteristics | Notable Projects |
|-------|------|---------|
| **MIT** | Most permissive, almost no restrictions | React, Vue, jQuery |
| **Apache 2.0** | Must retain copyright notice, includes patent grant | Android, Kubernetes |
| **GPL** | Derivative works must also be open source | Linux, WordPress |
| **BSD** | Similar to MIT, with slight differences | FreeBSD, Flask |

### 2.2 How to Choose?

- **Want more people to use it**: Choose MIT
- **Want to protect patents**: Choose Apache 2.0
- **Want to ensure derivatives stay open source**: Choose GPL

## 3. Collaboration Etiquette

### 3.1 Etiquette for Filing Issues

```markdown
<!-- Bad -->
Title: It doesn't work
Content: Your stuff has bugs

<!-- Good -->
Title: v2.1.0 login page shows white screen on Safari 17
Content:
- Environment: macOS 14.2, Safari 17.2
- Steps to reproduce: 1. Open login page 2. Enter credentials 3. Click login
- Expected behavior: Redirect to home page
- Actual behavior: White screen, console error TypeError: xxx
- Screenshot: [attached]
```

### 3.2 Etiquette for Submitting PRs

- Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` first to understand the project's contribution guidelines
- One PR should do one thing only — don't mix multiple changes
- Keep PRs small and focused for easier review
- Be patient waiting for review and respond to feedback politely

### 3.3 Reviewing Others' Code

- Acknowledge what's done well first, then suggest improvements
- Ask rather than command: "Have you considered using approach X here?"
- Give reasons and alternatives, not just "not good"

## 4. Contributing from Scratch

### 4.1 Beginner-Friendly Contribution Types

| Type | Difficulty | Description |
|------|------|------|
| Fix documentation errors | Low | Typos, outdated links, unclear instructions |
| Translation | Low | Translate documentation into other languages |
| Add tests | Medium | Write tests for uncovered code |
| Fix bugs tagged `good first issue` | Medium | Beginner-friendly issues marked by project maintainers |
| New features | High | Discuss the approach in an Issue first, get approval before starting |

### 4.2 Finding the Right Project

- Start with tools you use daily
- Search for `good first issue` labels on GitHub
- Check project activity (are there recent maintainers?)

## 5. AI-Powered: Using LLMs to Accelerate Open Source Contributions

LLMs can help you quickly understand unfamiliar codebases, write high-quality PR descriptions, and even assist with code reviews.

### 5.1 Quickly Understanding Unfamiliar Codebases

> **Prompt**:
> ```
> I just cloned an open source project. Please analyze the following
> directory structure, explain the responsibility of each directory/file,
> and describe the overall architecture and data flow.
> I want to fix a login-related bug — where should I start looking?
>
> [Paste tree command output or directory structure]
> ```

### 5.2 Writing PR Descriptions

> **Prompt**:
> ```
> Based on the following git diff, write a Pull Request description including:
> - Title (concise, stating what changed)
> - Change description (why and what changed)
> - Testing method (how to verify the change is correct)
> - Related issue (if any)
> Write in English with a professional and friendly tone.
>
> [Paste git diff output]
> ```

### 5.3 Assisting with Document Translation

> **Prompt**:
> ```
> Translate the following Chinese technical document into English, with these requirements:
> 1. Use industry-standard English expressions for technical terms
> 2. Do not translate code comments and variable names
> 3. Keep Markdown formatting unchanged
> 4. Natural and fluent tone, not machine-translated
>
> [Paste Chinese document]
> ```

::: tip AI Usage Advice
When using AI to write PR descriptions, make sure you understand every line of change. Reviewers may ask why you made a certain change — if you can't answer, it means you haven't truly understood it yet.

## 6. Summary

1. **Process**: Fork → Branch → Commit → PR → Review → Merge
2. **Licenses**: MIT is most permissive, GPL is most strict — choose based on your needs
3. **Etiquette**: Clear issues, focused PRs, polite communication
4. **Getting Started**: Start with documentation fixes and `good first issue` labels

::: tip Final Thought
The essence of open source is **collaboration**. Technical skills are important, but communication skills and collaboration awareness are equally crucial. A friendly, well-described PR is more welcome than a perfectly coded but rudely communicated one. **Your first PR doesn't need to be perfect — it just needs to be your first step.**
