# AI Agents and Tool Calling
> 💡 **Learning Guide**: This chapter requires no programming background. Through interactive demos, you'll gain a deep understanding of how AI Agents work. We'll start from the basics of "tool calling" and work our way up to how Agents plan, remember, and collaborate.

<AgentQuickStartDemo />

## 0. Introduction: From "Talking" to "Doing"

You've probably used chatbots like ChatGPT or Claude. They're powerful, but have one obvious limitation:

**They can only "talk," not "do"**

```
You: Check today's weather in Beijing for me
ChatGPT: I cannot access real-time weather information. I suggest you check a weather forecast website...
```

ChatGPT is like a **knowledgeable but immobile scholar** — it knows a lot, but can't execute any actual operations for you.

### 0.1 Core Challenge: How to Make AI Go from "Chatting" to "Acting"?

To achieve this goal, we need to solve three core challenges:

1.  **Tools**: How to let AI call external tools (search, calculate, file operations)?
2.  **Planning**: How to let AI break down complex tasks into executable steps?
3.  **Memory**: How to let AI remember context and avoid "goldfish memory"?

This tutorial will guide you step by step through the process of building an Agent from scratch.

---

## 1. First Step: Tool Calling

Computers can do many things: search the web, run code, manipulate files, send emails...

But LLMs inherently **do not** have these capabilities. Its core ability is just one thing: **generating text**.

### 1.1 Why Can't LLMs Execute Operations Directly?

An LLM is a **pure text processor**:

-   **Input**: Text (your question)
-   **Processing**: Internal computation, predicting the next token
-   **Output**: Text (the response)

It runs in an isolated environment, unable to access the internet, execute code, or read your local files.

### 1.2 Solution: Tool Calling

To make LLMs "take action," we invented the **Tool Calling** mechanism:

**Core idea**: The LLM doesn't execute operations directly, but instead **generates "call instructions"** for external systems to execute.

```
User: What's the weather like in Beijing today?

LLM thinks: The user is asking about weather, I should call the weather API

LLM generates call instruction:
{
  "tool": "weather_api",
  "params": {
    "city": "Beijing",
    "date": "today"
  }
}

External system executes tool → Returns result: "Sunny, 25°C"

LLM generates final answer: "The weather in Beijing today is sunny, temperature is 25 degrees..."
```

<AgentToolUseDemo />

**Key point**: The essence of Tool Calling is that the **LLM generates structured text** telling the external system what to do.

---

## 2. Core Challenge: How to Complete Complex Tasks?

Tool calling gives LLMs the ability to "act," but real-world tasks are often complex:

```
User: Research the latest trends in AI Agents and write a brief report
```

This task involves multiple steps:
1.  Search for the latest information
2.  Read relevant articles
3.  Extract key information
4.  Organize and analyze
5.  Write the report

### 2.1 Why is Planning Needed?

If you let the LLM generate a report "in one shot," the results are often:

-   **Incomplete information**: Only based on training data, missing the latest information
-   **Disorganized structure**: No clear logical framework
-   **Uncontrollable quality**: No way to verify the correctness of intermediate steps

### 2.2 Solution: Planning

An Agent acts like a **project manager**, first breaking down the big task into small steps:

<AgentPlanningDemo />

**Core planning process**:

1.  **Understand the goal**: Analyze user requirements
2.  **Task decomposition**: Break complex tasks into atomic operations
3.  **Step execution**: Call tools one by one to complete
4.  **Dynamic adjustment**: Adjust subsequent plans based on intermediate results

---

## 3. Memory System: Beyond the Current Conversation

Humans can remember things from long ago, but an LLM's "memory" is very limited:

-   **Context window limit**: Usually only a few thousand to tens of thousands of characters
-   **Session isolation**: Each conversation is a fresh start
-   **No persistence**: Close the page and it "forgets everything"

### 3.1 Why is Memory Needed?

Imagine this scenario:

```
User: My name is Zhang San
Agent: Hello Zhang San, nice to meet you!

... (chatting about many other topics) ...

User: What did I say my name was?
Agent: Sorry, I don't remember...
```

Without memory, an Agent cannot provide **personalized** services.

### 3.2 Solution: Three-Layer Memory Architecture

Agents typically use three types of memory working together:

<AgentMemoryDemo />

**Division of labor among three types of memory**:

| Memory Type | Purpose | Stored Content | Persistence |
|:--------|:-----|:---------|:-------|
| **Short-term Memory** | Current conversation context | Complete conversation history | ❌ Cleared when session ends |
| **Working Memory** | Temporary variables and state | Task progress, user preferences | ❌ Cleared when task ends |
| **Long-term Memory** | Cross-session knowledge | User profiles, historical records | ✅ Persistent storage |

---

## 4. The Core Loop of an Agent

Now let's integrate the three core capabilities and look at the complete workflow of an Agent:

<AgentWorkflowDemo />

The **perceive-decide-act-observe** loop continues until the task is complete.

---

## 5. Agent Capability Levels

Not all Agents are equally powerful. Based on their capabilities, Agents can be divided into multiple levels:

<AgentLevelDemo />

**Description of each level**:

| Level | Name | Core Capability | Typical Application |
|:-----|:-----|:---------|:---------|
| **L0** | No Tools | Conversation only, cannot execute | Chatbots |
| **L1** | Single Tool | Uses one fixed tool | Code interpreter |
| **L2** | Multi-Tool | Can select from multiple tools | Web Agent |
| **L3** | Multi-Step | Can plan complex tasks | Data analysis Agent |
| **L4** | Autonomous Iteration | Self-reflection and improvement | Research Agent |
| **L5** | Multi-Agent Collaboration | Multiple Agents working together | Enterprise systems |

---

## 6. Core Architecture of an Agent

A typical Agent consists of the following modules:

<AgentArchitectureDemo />

**Detailed explanation of each module**:

#### 1. **LLM (Brain)**

Responsible for understanding goals, generating plans, selecting actions, and organizing language output.

-   **Input**: User goal + current state + available tools list
-   **Output**: Next step plan / tool call parameters / final answer

#### 2. **Tools (Hands)**

Responsible for actually "doing things": searching, reading/writing files, calling APIs, running commands.

-   **Input**: tool_name + input_schema parameters
-   **Output**: Tool execution results (text/data/file changes)

#### 3. **Memory**

Stores "what has been done and what results were obtained" to avoid repetition and going off-track.

-   **Input**: Conversation history / tool results / current task state
-   **Output**: Searchable context (short-term/long-term/working memory)

#### 4. **Planning**

Breaks big goals into small steps and changes plans when failures occur.

-   **Input**: Goal + constraints (budget/time/safety) + current progress
-   **Output**: Step list / next action / stop condition

#### 5. **Guardrails**

Limits risks: permission allowlists, budget caps, confirmation for sensitive operations, sandbox execution.

## 7. Framework Comparison

There are many mainstream Agent development frameworks today, including LangChain, LlamaIndex, CrewAI, AutoGen, and Anthropic's official Claude Agent SDK. Each has its own characteristics and is suited for different scenarios.

<FrameworkComparisonDemo />

### 7.1 Core Difference: Official Native vs Third-Party Wrappers

| Comparison | Claude Agent SDK | LangChain / LlamaIndex / CrewAI etc. |
|--------|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Developer** | Anthropic official | Third-party open source community |
| **Model optimization** | Deeply optimized for Claude | Multi-model general, requires self-tuning |
| **Built-in tools** | Read/write files, Bash, search, etc. out of the box | Requires self-integration or configuration |
| **Agent Loop** | Built-in, no implementation needed | Requires self-assembly or reliance on framework abstractions |
| **Code generation quality** | Specifically optimized for code scenarios | General-purpose design, code capability depends on the model itself |
| **Learning curve** | Low, concise API | Medium-high, many concepts and complex abstraction layers |

### 7.2 Claude Agent SDK vs LangChain

**LangChain** is one of the most popular Agent frameworks, providing rich components and chain-call capabilities:

```python
# LangChain: requires assembling multiple components
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor, create_react_agent
from langchain.tools import tool
from langchain import hub

@tool
def read_file(path: str) -> str:
    """Read file contents"""
    with open(path) as f:
        return f.read()

# You need to define your own prompt, assemble the agent, and handle the tool loop
prompt = hub.pull("hwchase17/react")
agent = create_react_agent(llm, [read_file], prompt)
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=[read_file])
result = agent_executor.invoke({"input": "Fix the bug in auth.py"})
```

```python
# Claude Agent SDK: One line does it all, tools built-in
from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions

async for message in query(
    prompt="Fix the bug in auth.py",
    options=ClaudeAgentOptions(allowed_tools=["Read", "Edit", "Bash"]),
):
    print(message)
```

**Key differences**:
- LangChain is a **toolbox**, you need to select components and assemble the workflow yourself
- Agent SDK is a **finished product**, already tuned for code scenarios, ready to use

### 7.3 Claude Agent SDK vs CrewAI

**CrewAI** focuses on multi-Agent collaboration, emphasizing role-playing and task assignment:

```python
# CrewAI: Define multiple roles collaborating
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew

coder = Agent(role="Programmer", goal="Write code", backstory="...")
reviewer = Agent(role="Reviewer", goal="Review code", backstory="...")

task = Task(description="Develop feature", agent=coder)
crew = Crew(agents=[coder, reviewer], tasks=[task])
result = crew.kickoff()
```

**Key differences**:
- CrewAI excels at **role-playing** and **collaborative workflow** design, suitable for simulating team workflows
- Agent SDK focuses on **code execution** and **tool calling**, suitable for actual development tasks

### 7.4 Claude Agent SDK vs LlamaIndex

**LlamaIndex** is fundamentally about RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), focusing on connecting LLMs with external data:

```python
# LlamaIndex: Build knowledge base queries
from llama_index import VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader

documents = SimpleDirectoryReader("data").load_data()
index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents)
query_engine = index.as_query_engine()
response = query_engine.query("Summarize this document")
```

**Key differences**:
- LlamaIndex is a **data connector**, solving "how to let LLMs access my data"
- Agent SDK is a **task executor**, solving "how to let LLMs complete complex development tasks"

### 7.5 Comprehensive Comparison Table

| Feature | Claude Agent SDK | LangChain | CrewAI | LlamaIndex | AutoGen |
|:-----|:-----------------|:----------|:-------|:-----------|:--------|
| **Developer** | Anthropic official | Third-party | Third-party | Third-party | Microsoft |
| **Core Positioning** | Code development Agent | General LLM framework | Role-driven teams | Data retrieval augmentation | Multi-Agent collaboration |
| **Learning Curve** | Gentle | Medium | Gentle | Medium | Steep |
| **Built-in Tools** | ✅ Rich (files, Bash, search) | Requires configuration | Requires configuration | Requires configuration | ✅ Code execution |
| **Multi-Agent** | ✅ Supported | Via LangGraph | ✅ Native | ❌ | ✅ Native |
| **Code Scenarios** | ✅ Deeply optimized | General | General | Not applicable | ✅ Programming support |
| **Model Binding** | Claude exclusive | Multi-model | Multi-model | Multi-model | Multi-model |
| **Use Cases** | Automated development, CI/CD | Enterprise customization | Content creation/research | Knowledge base Q&A | Programming/data analysis |

### 7.6 Framework Selection Recommendations

    def __init__(self):
        self.tools = {
            "weather": self.get_weather,
            "calculate": self.calculate
        }

    def get_weather(self, city):
        # Simulate weather query
        return f"The weather in {city} today is sunny, 25°C"

    def calculate(self, expression):
        # Safe calculation (in real applications, a stricter sandbox is needed)
        try:
            result = eval(expression, {"__builtins__": {}}, {})
            return f"Calculation result: {result}"
        except:
            return "Calculation error"

    def decide_tool(self, user_input):
        """Simple intent recognition"""
        if "weather" in user_input:
            return "weather", user_input.split("weather")[0].strip()
        elif any(op in user_input for op in ["+", "-", "*", "/"]):
            return "calculate", user_input
        return None, None

    def run(self, user_input):
        tool_name, params = self.decide_tool(user_input)

        if tool_name:
            result = self.tools[tool_name](params)
            return f"[Called {tool_name}] {result}"
        else:
            return "I'm not sure how to help you. Try asking about weather or calculations"

# Usage
agent = SimpleAgent()
print(agent.run("How's the weather in Beijing?"))
# Output: [Called weather] The weather in Beijing today is sunny, 25°C
```

            "read": self.read_page,
            "summarize": self.summarize
        }
        self.memory = []

    def web_search(self, query):
        # Simulate search
        return [f"Article 1 about '{query}'", f"Article 2 about '{query}'"]

    def read_page(self, url):
        # Simulate reading
        return f"Content summary of {url}..."

    def summarize(self, texts):
        # Simulate summarization
        return "Summary: " + "; ".join(texts)[:100] + "..."

    def plan(self, goal):
        """Generate execution plan based on goal"""
        if "search" in goal or "look up" in goal:
            return [
                ("search", goal),
                ("read", "result_0"),
                ("summarize", "all_content")
            ]
        return []

    def run(self, goal):
        print(f"🎯 Goal: {goal}")

        # 1. Make a plan
        plan = self.plan(goal)
        print(f"📋 Plan: {len(plan)} steps")

        # 2. Execute the plan
        results = []
        for i, (tool_name, params) in enumerate(plan):
            print(f"\n  Step {i+1}: Call {tool_name}")
            result = self.tools[tool_name](params)
            results.append(result)
            self.memory.append({"step": i, "tool": tool_name, "result": result})

        # 3. Return final result
        return results[-1] if results else "Cannot complete"

# Usage
agent = PlanningAgent()
result = agent.run("Search for the latest developments in AI Agents and summarize")
print(f"\n✅ Result: {result}")
```
