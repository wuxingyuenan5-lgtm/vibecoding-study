# Introduction to Type Systems

::: tip Preface
**Why does `"1" + 1` produce `"11"` in JavaScript but throw an error in Python?** Behind this is the type system at work. A type system is the "traffic rules" of a programming language — it determines how data can be used, what it can be combined with, and when things are checked for validity. Understanding type systems helps you understand the "personality differences" between languages.

## 0. Big Picture: Types Are the "ID Cards" of Data

In the real world, you wouldn't stuff a book into a coffee mug — because they are different "types" of things. The programming world is the same: numbers, strings, booleans, arrays... each type of data has its own "identity" that determines what operations it can participate in.

A **type system** is the rule system a programming language uses to manage these "identities." It answers two core questions:

::: tip Two Core Questions of Type Systems
- **When to check?** At compile time (static typing) or at runtime (dynamic typing)?
- **How strict?** Strictly prohibit mixing (strong typing) or automatically convert for you (weak typing)?

## 1. What Is a Type System: Traffic Rules for Data

<TypeSystemDemo />

The essence of a type system is a set of **constraint rules** that tell the compiler or interpreter:

- What values can this variable hold?
- Can these two values be added together?
- What type should this function's parameter be?

A world without a type system is like a road without traffic rules — any data can be combined with any other data, with completely unpredictable results.

| Role of Type Systems | Description | Example |
|-------------|------|------|
| Prevent illegal operations | Block meaningless operations | Can't divide a string |
| Provide documentation | Types are the best documentation | `function add(a: number, b: number)` is self-explanatory |
| Support IDE tooling | Auto-completion, refactoring, navigation | Type `user.` and get suggestions for all properties |
| Optimize performance | Compilers can generate faster code knowing the types | Use integer instructions when the type is known to be an integer |

## 2. Static vs Dynamic Typing: When to Check?

This is the most important classification dimension of type systems — **check timing**.

<StaticVsDynamicDemo />

::: tip Core Difference
- **Static typing**: Variable types are determined at compile time. Type errors are caught before the code even runs. Representatives: Java, TypeScript, Rust, Go.
- **Dynamic typing**: Variable types are determined at runtime. The same variable can store a number first and then a string. Representatives: Python, JavaScript, Ruby, PHP.
:::

| Dimension | Static Typing | Dynamic Typing |
|------|---------|---------|
| Check timing | Compile time (checked before running) | Runtime (checked when that line executes) |
| Bug detection | Early (known right after writing) | Late (exposed during user interaction) |
| Flexibility | Lower (fixed types) | Higher (types can change) |
| IDE support | Good (auto-completion, refactoring) | Weaker (types only known at runtime) |
| Development speed | Slower initially (must write types) | Faster initially (no need to manage types) |
| Maintenance cost | Low (types serve as documentation) | High (lack of type information) |

::: tip Trend: Dynamic Languages Are Going "Static"
Python added Type Hints, and the JavaScript community shifted to TypeScript — dynamic languages are embracing the benefits of static typing. This shows that in large projects, the safety advantages of static typing are increasingly recognized.

## 3. Strong vs Weak Typing: Allow "Sneaky Conversions"?

The second classification dimension is **strictness of type conversion**.

<StrongVsWeakDemo />

::: tip Core Difference
- **Strong typing**: Implicit type conversions are not allowed. Type mismatches cause errors. You must explicitly tell the language "I want to convert this string to a number."
- **Weak typing**: Implicit type conversions are allowed. The language "helpfully" converts types automatically. But this "helpfulness" often introduces unexpected bugs.
:::

| Dimension | Strong Typing | Weak Typing |
|------|-------|-------|
| `"1" + 1` | Error or requires explicit conversion | Auto-converts (may produce `"11"` or `2`) |
| Safety | High (won't fail silently) | Low (implicit conversions can cause bugs) |
| Convenience | Low (requires manual conversion) | High (auto-conversion saves effort) |
| Predictability | High (behavior is deterministic) | Low (conversion rules are complex) |

---

## 4. Type Inference: The Best of Both Worlds

Early statically typed languages (like Java) required you to explicitly declare the type of every variable, which was verbose. Modern languages solve this through **type inference** — the compiler automatically infers types. You don't have to write them, but the compiler still checks strictly.

<TypeInferenceFlowDemo />

::: tip The Value of Type Inference
Write code as concisely as a dynamic language, with compiler checking as strict as a static language. This is the mainstream direction of modern programming languages.
- **TypeScript**: `let x = 42` is automatically inferred as `number`
- **Rust**: `let v = vec![1, 2, 3]` is automatically inferred as `Vec<i32>`
- **Kotlin**: `val name = "Alice"` is automatically inferred as `String`
- **Go**: `x := 42` short variable declaration automatically infers the type
:::

## 5. Generics: Write Once, Work for All Types

When you write a function to "get the first element of an array," you'll find: you need one version for number arrays, another for string arrays, yet another for object arrays... The code is exactly the same, only the type differs. **Generics** solve this problem — use a "type parameter" in place of a concrete type, letting one piece of code work for all types.

<GenericTypeDemo />

::: tip Core Value of Generics
- **Code reuse**: One function/class works for all types without repetition
- **Type safety**: Unlike `any` which abandons type checking, generics preserve type information throughout
- **Type constraints**: Use `extends` to limit the scope of generics, achieving both flexibility and safety
:::

| Generic Feature | Description | Example |
|---------|------|------|
| Generic function | Function parameters/return values use type parameters | `function first<T>(arr: T[]): T` |
| Generic class | Class properties/methods use type parameters | `class Box<T> { value: T }` |
| Generic constraints | Use extends to limit T's scope | `<T extends HasLength>` |
| Multiple type parameters | Use multiple type variables simultaneously | `function pair<K, V>(k: K, v: V)` |

## 6. Type Safety in Practice: Common Pitfalls and Defenses

Having covered the theory, let's look at the most common type-related pitfalls in real development. These pitfalls span languages — almost every developer encounters them.

<TypeSafetyPracticeDemo />

::: tip Four Golden Rules of Type Safety
1. **Enable strict mode**: TypeScript's `strict: true`, Python's `mypy --strict`
2. **Avoid any**: Use `unknown` instead of `any`, forcing you to perform type checks before using the value
3. **Handle null explicitly**: Use optional chaining `?.` and nullish coalescing `??` for safe access
4. **Define interfaces for APIs**: External data is never trustworthy — use interfaces + runtime validation for double protection
:::

| Pitfall | Danger Level | Defense |
|------|---------|---------|
| null/undefined references | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | strictNullChecks + optional chaining |
| any type abuse | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Use unknown + type guards |
| Implicit type conversion | ⭐⭐⭐ | Strict comparison === + ESLint |
| Inconsistent array types | ⭐⭐⭐ | Explicitly declare array element types |

## 7. Language Type Quadrant Chart: "Profiling" Programming Languages

Combining the "static/dynamic" and "strong/weak" dimensions creates a four-quadrant classification chart. Every programming language can be placed on this chart.

<LanguageTypeModelDemo />

| Quadrant | Characteristics | Representative Languages | Use Cases |
|------|------|---------|---------|
| Static + Strong | Safest, strict compile-time checking | Rust, Java, Haskell | Large systems, safety-critical |
| Static + Weak | Compile-time checking but allows implicit conversion | C, C++ | Systems programming, performance-sensitive |
| Dynamic + Strong | Runtime checking, no implicit conversion | Python, Ruby | Scripts, rapid prototyping |
| Dynamic + Weak | Most flexible, also most bug-prone | JavaScript, PHP | Web frontend, small scripts |

::: tip No "Best" Type System
When choosing a language, the type system is an important consideration:
- **Rapid prototyping**: Dynamic typing (Python) for fast development
- **Large projects**: Static typing (TypeScript, Java) for lower maintenance costs
- **Systems programming**: Strong + static (Rust) for highest safety
- **Team collaboration**: Static typing provides better code readability and IDE support

## Summary

Type systems are a key perspective for understanding differences between programming languages. They're not dry theory — they directly affect your coding experience and code quality.

Review the key points of this chapter:

1. **Types are ID cards**: Every piece of data has a type that determines what operations it can participate in
2. **Static vs Dynamic**: When to check types — compile time or runtime
3. **Strong vs Weak**: Whether implicit type conversions are allowed
4. **Type inference**: Modern languages let you enjoy dynamic conciseness with static safety
5. **Generics**: Use type parameters for code reuse, balancing flexibility and type safety
6. **Type safety in practice**: null references, any abuse, and implicit conversion are the most common type pitfalls
7. **Four-quadrant classification**: There's no best type system, only the most suitable choice for the scenario
