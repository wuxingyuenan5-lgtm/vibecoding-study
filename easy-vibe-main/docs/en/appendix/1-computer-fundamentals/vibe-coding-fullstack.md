# Full-Stack Development in the Vibe Coding Era

::: tip Preface
**What is Vibe Coding?** Simply put, it's "writing code with natural language" — you describe what you want in Chinese or English, and AI generates the code for you. This has completely changed the rules of the software development game.

But here's a key question: **AI can help you write code, but AI can't think for you.** You still need to know "what to write," "why to write it this way," and "how to judge if it's correct." This is exactly the foundational cognitive framework this chapter will help you build.
:::

**What will you learn from this article?**

After completing this chapter, you will gain:

- **Domain overview**: Know what frontend, backend, AI algorithms, and other directions each do

## 1. Computer Domain Overview

Before diving into each direction, let's first build a holistic understanding.

<ComputerFieldMapDemo />

### 1.1 Understanding Each Domain Through a "Restaurant" Analogy

Think of a software system as a **restaurant**:

| Domain | Restaurant Role | What They Do | Output |
|-----|---------|--------|--------|
| **Frontend** | Decor + Menu + Waiter | Everything users can see and interact with | Webpages, mini-programs, app interfaces |
| **Backend** | Kitchen + Warehouse | Process business logic and store data | APIs, databases, server programs |
| **Mobile** | Takeout Window | Mobile app experience | iOS/Android Apps |
| **AI/Algorithms** | R&D Department | Make the system "smart" | Recommendation models, image recognition, intelligent chat |
| **DevOps** | Property Management + Security | Ensure stable system operation | Deployment scripts, monitoring systems, security protection |
| **Data Engineering** | Finance + Analysts | Data collection, storage, analysis | Data pipelines, reports, dashboards |

### 1.2 Tech Stack Overview by Domain

Don't be intimidated by these terms — this is just to give you exposure:

| Domain | Core Languages | Common Frameworks/Tools | Typical Output |
|-----|---------|--------------|---------|
| Frontend | JavaScript, TypeScript | React, Vue, CSS | Webpages, admin dashboards |
| Backend | Node.js, Go, Java, Python | Express, Gin, Spring | API services |
| Mobile | Swift, Kotlin, Dart | SwiftUI, Jetpack, Flutter | Mobile apps |
| AI/Algorithms | Python | PyTorch, TensorFlow | Models, algorithms |
| DevOps | Shell, Python | Docker, Kubernetes | Deployment solutions |

::: tip Advice for Beginners
Don't try to learn everything at once. Pick one direction to go deep first, establish a "base camp," then expand horizontally. Full-stack doesn't mean "knowing a little about everything" — it means "having one core strength while being functional in other areas."

## 2. What Is Frontend?

### 2.1 One-Sentence Definition

**Frontend = everything the user can directly see, click, and interact with.**

When you open a webpage:
- Page layout, colors, fonts → Frontend
- Animation effects after clicking a button → Frontend
- Form inputs and data display → Frontend
- How the page adapts to mobile screens → Frontend

### 2.2 The Frontend Trio

<FrontendTriadDemo />

**Using "house renovation" as an analogy:**

| Technology | Renovation Role | Responsibility |
|-----|---------|------|
| **HTML** | House structure | Where walls are, where doors are, how rooms are divided |
| **CSS** | Decorative style | Wall colors, furniture arrangement, lighting effects |
| **JavaScript** | Smart home | Light switches, automatic curtains, security system |

### 2.3 Frontend Frameworks: Why Use Them?

You can write webpages with plain HTML/CSS/JS, so why learn frameworks like React and Vue?

<FrontendFrameworkDemo />

**Core reason**: When pages become complex (like Taobao or WeChat web version), directly manipulating page elements one by one becomes very messy. Frameworks help you "manage complexity."

### 2.4 A Day in the Life of a Frontend Engineer

```
9:00  Review design mockups, understand feature requirements
10:00 Write component code with React/Vue
12:00 Lunch break
14:00 Work with backend on API integration, debug data display
16:00 Fix bugs, optimize page performance
18:00 Code review, discuss technical solutions with the team
```

## 3. What Is Backend?

### 3.1 One-Sentence Definition

**Backend = the logic users can't see but that powers the entire system.**

When you place an online order:
- Verifying your username and password → Backend
- Checking product inventory → Backend
- Calculating discounted prices → Backend
- Generating the order and processing payment → Backend
- Notifying the warehouse to ship → Backend

### 3.2 Core Backend Responsibilities

<BackendCoreDemo />

**Using "restaurant kitchen" as an analogy:**

| Backend Responsibility | Kitchen Analogy | Details |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **API Design** | Menu design | Define "what dishes users can order" and "how to order" |
| **Business Logic** | Cooking process | Process orders, calculate prices, verify permissions |
| **Data Storage** | Warehouse management | Store data in databases, query data |
| **Performance Optimization** | Kitchen efficiency | Caching, async processing, load balancing |
| **Security** | Food safety | Prevent SQL injection, access control |

### 3.3 Which Backend Language to Choose?

| Language | Characteristics | Best For |
|-----|------|---------|
| **Node.js** | Frontend-friendly, JavaScript full-stack | Small-to-medium projects, rapid prototyping |
| **Go** | High performance, strong concurrency | High-concurrency services, microservice architecture |
| **Java** | Mature ecosystem, enterprise-grade | Large enterprise systems, banking |
| **Python** | Clean syntax, great AI ecosystem | Data processing, AI services |

::: tip Beginner Advice
If you already know JavaScript (frontend basics), Node.js is the most natural backend entry point. One language for both frontend and backend.

## 4. Programming Language Landscape

### 4.1 What Are Programming Languages?

**Programming languages = the bridge between humans and computers.**

Computers only understand 0s and 1s, while humans prefer natural language. Programming languages are the middle layer:
- Humans write code in programming languages (more understandable than 0/1)
- Computers translate programming languages into machine instructions

### 4.2 Language Classification

<ProgrammingLanguageMapDemo />

**By execution method:**

| Type | Principle | Representative Languages | Characteristics |
|-----|------|---------|------|
| **Compiled** | Translate to machine code first, then run | C, C++, Go, Rust | Fast execution, slow compilation |
| **Interpreted** | Translate and run simultaneously | Python, JavaScript, Ruby | Fast development, slow execution |
| **Bytecode** | Compromise approach | Java, Kotlin, C# | Balances performance and development efficiency |

**By type system:**

| Type | Characteristics | Representative Languages |
|-----|------|---------|
| **Static typing** | Variable types determined at compile time | Java, TypeScript, Go |
| **Dynamic typing** | Variable types determined at runtime | Python, JavaScript, Ruby |
| **Strong typing** | Strict type checking, no auto-conversion | Python, Java |
| **Weak typing** | Loose type checking, auto-conversion | JavaScript, PHP |

### 4.3 Which Language Should You Learn?

<LanguageSelectionDemo />

::: tip Selection Principles
There is no "best language," only the "most suitable language for the scenario." Beginner recommendations:
1. **Learn one language deeply first**: Build programming thinking
2. **Then learn a second one for comparison**: Understand language design differences
3. **Learn on demand**: Choose based on project requirements
