# How to Choose the Right Platform for Your Application

You have an idea and want to turn it into a real product. But with so many platform options - WeChat Mini Programs, iOS apps, Android apps, websites, browser extensions, desktop applications - where should you start?

::: tip 💡 Quick Navigation
If you already know the characteristics of each platform, you can jump directly to [Section 2](#2-ask-yourself-three-questions-first) for the decision process, or see [the decision flowchart in Section 7](#7-summary-platform-selection-decision-flow).
:::

This article will help you sort out your thinking and find the most suitable development platform based on your specific scenario.

## 1 Know These Platforms First

Before discussing "which one to choose," first understand "which ones exist." Below are the mainstream platform categories right now:

### 1.1 Mobile Platforms

#### iOS Native App

The apps you download from the App Store on your iPhone are iOS native apps. Their features are: fast launch, smooth experience, and full access to phone capabilities (camera, location, health data, etc.). But development requires a Mac, and App Store release requires Apple's review.

**Common examples**: WeChat, Douyin (TikTok China), Xiaohongshu, Keep, Meituan, Alipay

#### Android Native App

Apps downloaded from Android app stores, or installed from APK files sent by friends, are Android native apps. They are similar to iOS apps, but Android has more users and more distribution channels. The downside is device fragmentation: developers must adapt to many screen sizes and system versions.

**Common examples**: Tasker (automation), MX Player (video player), AirDroid (phone manager), Greenify (battery optimization), Xposed Framework (system customization)

#### WeChat Mini Program

The "small apps" you can use directly inside WeChat by scanning a code or searching by name, with no installation needed. The advantage is low user friction: everyone already has WeChat, so users can start instantly. The downside is limited capabilities, and it only runs inside WeChat.

**Common examples**: Pinduoduo (group-buy e-commerce), Meituan Waimai (local services), Mobike (bike sharing), Jump Jump (mini game), Zhouheiya (ordering/shopping)

#### PWA (Progressive Web App)

It sounds technical, but it's basically "a web page that can be installed like an app." When users open a site in a mobile browser, they may see "Add to Home Screen." After one tap, an icon appears on the home screen and behaves like an app. The advantage is one codebase for mobile and desktop. The downside is many users do not know this usage pattern.

**Common examples**: Twitter Lite, Starbucks, Pinterest, Uber, Spotify Web Player

### 1.2 Desktop Platforms

#### Electron Desktop App

You might use them every day: VS Code, Slack, Discord, Notion, Figma - all built with Electron. The key feature is: build desktop software using web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), and run one codebase across Windows, Mac, and Linux. The downside is larger installers and higher runtime memory usage.

**Common examples**: VS Code, Slack, Discord, Notion, Figma, WeChat Developer Tools

#### Qt Desktop Application

If you have used WPS, VirtualBox, or OBS, they may have been built with Qt. Qt uses C++, with good performance and stability, especially suitable for industrial scenarios. But the learning curve is higher, and C++ knowledge is required.

**Common examples**: WPS Office, VirtualBox, Autodesk Maya, Telegram Desktop, OBS Studio

#### Native Desktop Application

These "heavyweight" applications are usually built with native technologies. Windows often uses C# or C++; macOS uses Swift. They provide the best performance and smoothest experience, but Windows and macOS versions must be developed separately, which is expensive.

**Common examples**: Microsoft Office, Adobe Photoshop, Final Cut Pro, WeChat (Windows/Mac), QQ Music

### 1.3 Web-Related Platforms

#### Website

These are pages opened by entering URLs in a browser. Advantages: accessible on any device (phone, computer, tablet), no installation required, and searchable by search engines. Downside: internet connection is required, so offline usage is unavailable.

**Common examples**: Taobao, Zhihu, GitHub, Bilibili, Juejin, CSDN

#### Browser Extension

Have you used ad blockers, translation tools, or password managers? These are browser extensions. They run inside browsers and can read/modify web page content. For example, install a translation extension and translate English pages with one click. Advantage: lightweight and starts with browser. Downside: works only in browsers, and extensions are not always cross-compatible across Chrome, Edge, and Firefox.

**Common examples**: AdBlock Plus, Immersive Translate, 1Password, Grammarly, Tampermonkey, Dark Reader

### 1.4 Other Platforms

#### VS Code Extension

If you are a developer, you likely use VS Code. VS Code extensions are small programs that "add features" to the editor. Advantage: highly targeted developer audience. Downside: only useful for developer users.

**Common examples**: Prettier, GitLens, GitHub Copilot, ESLint, Live Server, Chinese Language Pack

#### NFT Smart Contract

You may have heard about NFTs - those "digital avatars" sold for millions. NFTs are essentially blockchain-based ownership certificates proving a digital item belongs to you. Smart contracts are programs running on blockchain to create and manage NFTs. Advantage: tamper-resistant and tradable. Downside: high technical barrier and volatile market.

**Common examples**: BAYC, CryptoPunks, NBA Top Shot, Azuki, Moonbirds

### 1.5 Are There More Options?

Beyond the platforms above, there are also "middle paths" and more possibilities:

#### Cross-platform Frameworks

::: details Click to view cross-platform framework details

**React Native / Flutter**: want both iOS and Android without writing two codebases? These frameworks let you write once and generate apps for both platforms. Many companies use them, such as Airbnb and Instagram.

**Tauri**: a "lightweight alternative" to Electron. It also uses web tech to build desktop apps but with smaller installers and faster runtime. Downside: ecosystem is less mature.

**uni-app**: very popular in China. One codebase can target WeChat Mini Program, iOS app, Android app, and H5 website. Suitable for teams that want "build once, run everywhere."

**Capacitor / Ionic**: already have a website and want to quickly turn it into an app? These tools can "wrap" your website into an installable app for app stores.

These frameworks are essentially trade-offs between native and web development: higher development efficiency, but some compromises on performance and experience.

#### China Mini Program Ecosystem

::: details Click to view mini program options in China

**Alipay Mini Program**: finance and local service scenarios. If your users pay bills, order food, or use transit in Alipay, then Alipay Mini Program is a fit. Capabilities like Zhima credit and trust identity are unique to Alipay.

**Douyin Mini Program**: content commerce and livestream sales. If you sell on Douyin, mini programs can be attached under videos for instant conversion.

**Kuaishou Mini Program**: lower-tier markets and strong community economy. Kuaishou users are highly engaged, suitable for community group buying and local services.

**Baidu Mini Program**: search traffic entry. If users search "nearby restaurants" on Baidu, your mini program can appear directly in results.
:::

#### HarmonyOS Ecosystem

**HarmonyOS apps**: can run on Huawei phones, tablets, watches, and smart home devices. Developed with ArkTS (similar to TypeScript), one codebase can support multiple devices. If your audience is in Huawei ecosystem or your product involves IoT linkage, HarmonyOS is a key option.

#### More Developer Tools

::: details Click to view more developer tool options

**Command Line Tools (CLI)**: developers use terminal daily. CLI tools can automate repetitive work, generate code templates, and deploy projects. Examples include `create-react-app`, `git`, and `npm`. Suitable for developer productivity and DevOps automation.

**JetBrains plugins**: besides VS Code, many developers use IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, and WebStorm. If your tool targets Java, Python, or frontend developers, JetBrains Marketplace is also worth considering.

**Cursor / Windsurf plugins**: emerging ecosystems for AI coding tools. If you are building AI-assisted coding features, these IDE plugin ecosystems are growing quickly.
:::

#### Community Bots

::: details Click to view community bot options

**Telegram Bot**: large overseas user base and developer-friendly APIs. Suitable for notifications, automation tasks, and community management. Many crypto projects and dev communities use Telegram.

**Discord Bot**: core platform for gaming and developer communities. Useful for music playback, game data queries, and server management. If your users are gamers or overseas developers, Discord bots are often essential.
:::

#### Design and Productivity Tools

::: details Click to view design tool options

**Figma plugins**: designers use Figma every day. Plugins can automate design workflows, generate code, and manage design systems. Suitable for design tooling and frontend assistance.

**Notion integrations**: with Notion API you can automate workflows, sync data, and generate reports. Suitable for knowledge management and project management tools.
:::

#### Spatial Computing

**visionOS apps (Apple Vision Pro)**: the new era of spatial computing. Suitable for 3D content display, immersive experiences, education/training, and virtual collaboration. Technical barrier is high, but for frontier exploration this is a future direction.

## 4 Practical Scenario Examples

### Scenario 1: I want to build a community group-buy tool

**💡 Recommended: WeChat Mini Program**

Why mini program?

- **Users are already in WeChat**: community users are active in WeChat groups; mini programs can be shared directly in groups
- **Use-and-go behavior**: nobody wants to install a dedicated app just to order vegetables
- **Seamless payment**: one-tap WeChat Pay, no context switching
- **Low acquisition cost**: one group-sharing flow can bring dozens of users

::: tip 💡 Applicable scenarios
If your product is similar - group buying, booking, surveys, event signup - mini programs are usually the first choice.
:::

---

### Scenario 2: I want to build a running tracker app

**⚡ Recommended: iOS / Android Native**

Why native app?

- **Background running**: app must keep tracking route during running, which mini programs and websites cannot reliably do
- **GPS precision**: native apps can access high-precision location with small error range
- **Health data access**: step count and heart rate access needs Apple HealthKit / Google Fit
- **Reliable push reminders**: daily "time to run" reminders are best done via native push

::: warning ⚠️ Important note
Any app that requires **long-term background execution** or **deep hardware access** should choose native development.
:::

---

### Scenario 3: I want to build a bookkeeping app

**📝 Recommended: PWA or Mini Program**

Why?

- **High frequency but short sessions**: one record per day, done in 30 seconds
- **No complex hardware needs**: mostly data entry and display
- **Strong cross-platform requirement**: users may record on phone and review reports on desktop
- **Offline scenario**: users may want to log expenses in subway with no signal

PWA can be installed on home screen and feels like an app, while development cost is about one-third of native. Mini programs are often better for China users.

---

### Scenario 4: I want to build an online education platform

**📚 Recommended: Website + Mini Program combination**

Why?

- **Website handles acquisition**: course pages, instructor profiles, SEO optimization
- **Mini program handles conversion**: trial class, enrollment payment, group join via QR
- **Website handles delivery**: video playback is better on larger web screens
- **Mini program handles touchpoints**: class reminders and homework notifications

::: tip 💡 Combination strategy
Complex business often needs a **multi-platform combination**, not a single platform.
:::

---

### Scenario 5: I want to build a team collaboration tool

**🤝 Recommended: Electron desktop app + web version**

Why?

- **Desktop side**: users keep computers on at work; desktop apps can stay resident and receive messages
- **Web side**: temporary use on other computers without installation
- **System integration**: desktop app can access local files, system notifications, and shortcuts
- **One codebase**: Electron uses web stack, and desktop/web can reuse about 80% code

Slack, Notion, and Discord all follow this pattern.

---

### Scenario 6: I want to build a password manager

**🔐 Recommended: Desktop app + browser extension**

Why?

- **Desktop app**: secure local password database storage, supports biometric unlock
- **Browser extension**: autofill on login pages without switching windows
- **Offline availability**: password data stored locally, independent of network
- **Security control**: users know where their data is, reducing cloud leakage concerns

1Password and Bitwarden both use this combination.

---

### Scenario 7: I want to build a content creation platform

**✍️ Recommended: Website + personal blog**

Why?

- **SEO is the lifeline**: search is your largest long-term traffic source
- **Content is product**: articles, tutorials, and videos are core value
- **Long-term asset**: websites can operate for years, while social accounts can be suspended anytime
- **Flexible monetization**: ads, paid subscriptions, and knowledge commerce can all run on websites

Medium, Zhihu columns, and personal tech blogs are all essentially content platforms.

---

### Scenario 8: I want to build a developer productivity tool

**🛠️ Recommended: VS Code extension or CLI tool**

Why?

- **Users are already inside the editor**: developers dislike context switching
- **Context awareness**: tools can read current code and provide precise suggestions
- **Easy distribution**: publish to extension marketplace and users install with one click
- **Fast iteration**: no app store review delays, same-day release/update

Prettier, ESLint, and GitHub Copilot are all VS Code extensions.

---

### Scenario 9: I want to build an industrial monitoring dashboard

**🏭 Recommended: Qt desktop application**

Why?

- **Stability above all**: factories run 24/7 and software cannot crash
- **Hardware communication**: needs serial/Modbus communication with sensors
- **Real-time charting**: pressure/temperature/flow often need millisecond refresh
- **Industrial environment**: industrial computers commonly run Windows, and Qt compatibility is strong

::: warning ⚠️ Industrial scenarios
Industrial scenarios require stability and hardware interfaces that web technologies usually cannot satisfy.
:::

---

### Scenario 10: I want to issue a digital membership card

**🎫 Recommended: NFT smart contract**

Why?

- **Unforgeable**: on-chain records cannot be tampered with
- **Transferable**: memberships can be gifted or traded on secondary markets
- **Programmable**: smart contracts can automate benefits (for example auto-upgrade after one year)
- **Global reach**: no national boundaries, global participation possible

Starbucks Odyssey and NBA Top Shot both use NFTs in membership systems.

## 6 Common Misconceptions

<el-collapse accordion style="margin: 20px 0;">
  <el-collapse-item name="1">
    <template #title>
      <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #F56C6C;">❌ Misconception 1: "I want to build an app, so I must build both iOS and Android"</span>
    </template>
    <div style="padding: 10px; color: #606266; line-height: 1.8;">
      Not necessarily. If your app is lightweight and use-and-go, a mini program or PWA may be a better choice. Native development is worth it only when you need deep system access or top-end performance.
    </div>
  </el-collapse-item>
  
  <el-collapse-item name="2">
    <template #title>
      <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #F56C6C;">❌ Misconception 2: "Websites are outdated and nobody reads them anymore"</span>
    </template>
    <div style="padding: 10px; color: #606266; line-height: 1.8;">
      The opposite is true. Websites are the only platform indexable by search engines. If you want content-driven user growth, websites and personal blogs are top choices. Technical articles and project showcases can continuously bring SEO traffic.
    </div>
  </el-collapse-item>
  
  <el-collapse-item name="3">
    <template #title>
      <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #F56C6C;">❌ Misconception 3: "Desktop apps are no longer used"</span>
    </template>
    <div style="padding: 10px; color: #606266; line-height: 1.8;">
      In office scenarios, desktop apps are still mainstream. VS Code, Slack, and Notion are all desktop apps. If your app needs long-session usage, heavy data handling, or system integration, desktop is often the best choice.
    </div>
  </el-collapse-item>
  
  <el-collapse-item name="4">
    <template #title>
      <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #F56C6C;">❌ Misconception 4: "PWA experience is worse than native"</span>
    </template>
    <div style="padding: 10px; color: #606266; line-height: 1.8;">
      Modern PWAs are already very close to native experience. Starbucks, Pinterest, and Uber all have PWA versions. If your app does not require complex hardware integration, PWA is often the most cost-effective cross-platform solution.
    </div>
  </el-collapse-item>
</el-collapse>
