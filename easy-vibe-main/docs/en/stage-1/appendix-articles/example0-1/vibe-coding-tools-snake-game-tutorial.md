## 1. Introduction

In previous lessons, we've been using z.ai's full-stack development model to complete programming tasks.

However, have we ever thought: its core is actually "AI Agent" (different from ordinary chat-based AI, and much more intelligent)? This is because it doesn't just chat with you—it can also think (when you give it a task, it first makes a plan), and actively take actions (like calling web searches, executing computer commands, opening web pages, etc.). We will introduce this in detail later.

## 1. What is Vibe Coding?

Vibe Coding is a new software development method that uses AI to accelerate the application development process. It is not a replacement for traditional programming, but rather a more "conversational" programming model. This concept was proposed by AI researcher Andrej Karpathy: in this workflow, developers no longer write code line by line, but mainly guide AI Agents to generate, optimize, and debug applications.

The core idea of Vibe Coding shifts from **"code-first"** to **"intent-first"**. You no longer need to start from the first line of code, but describe the desired outcome in natural language.

A typical Vibe Coding workflow is an iterative loop:

- **Describe the Goal:** First describe the feature you want to implement in a sentence or paragraph, for example: "Make a simple Snake game with a Python backend that can generate poems."
- **AI Generates Code:** The AI Agent parses your requirements and generates the first version of the code, including the basic structure, frontend pages, and backend logic.
- **Run and Observe:** Run the generated code, check if it works as expected, and discover bugs or shortcomings.
- **Feedback and Iterate:** If there are errors or the results are unsatisfactory, continue giving instructions in the conversation, for example: "The snake moves too slowly, speed it up," or "The API Key in the `.env` file isn't being read correctly, please fix the backend code."
- **Repeat:** Continuously iterate through the "describe → generate → run → feedback" loop until the application reaches a satisfactory state.

### Main Advantages of Vibe Coding:

- **Lower Barrier:** Allows designers, entrepreneurs, students, and others without programming experience to participate in application development through natural language.
- **Faster Prototyping:** Significantly reduces the time from idea to Minimum Viable Product (MVP).
- **Improved Efficiency:** Automatically handles a large amount of repetitive, mechanical coding work (like template code), allowing developers to focus on architecture design and problem abstraction.
- **Encourages Experimentation:** Promotes a approach of quick output then continuous improvement, making it easier to try new ideas and features.

## 2. What is an AI Agent?

So what exactly is an AI Agent? Simply put, an AI Agent is an AI system that can **perceive environments, make decisions, and take actions** to achieve specific goals. Compared to simple chatbots that only respond to prompts, AI Agents have the following key characteristics:

### 2.1 Core Capabilities of AI Agents

| Capability | Description | Example |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| **Planning** | Break down complex tasks into multiple steps | When asked to "build a blog," automatically creates subtasks: design database, write API, build frontend, etc. |
| **Tool Use** | Call external tools to extend capabilities | Use browser to search for information, execute code, read/write files |
| **Memory** | Retain context and learn from interactions | Remember user preferences, reference previous conversation history |
| **Reflection** | Evaluate action results and adjust strategies | When code fails, analyze the error and try alternative solutions |

### 2.2 AI Agent vs. Traditional Programs

Let's compare AI Agents with traditional programs:

| Dimension | Traditional Programs | AI Agents |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Logic** | Hard-coded by developers | Learned from vast amounts of data |
| **Input** | Structured data (JSON, database) | Natural language, any form |
| **Output** | Determined results | Generative, creative content |
| **Adaptability** | Requires code changes to modify behavior | Can adapt through prompts or fine-tuning |

### 2.3 How AI Agents Work

The working principle of AI Agents can be summarized as a feedback loop:

```
Goal → Perception → Planning → Action → Evaluation → (Loop)
```

1. **Goal Setting:** The user provides a task goal in natural language.
2. **Perception:** The Agent understands the goal and gathers relevant information.
3. **Planning:** The Agent breaks down the goal into executable steps.
4. **Action:** The Agent executes the plan, potentially calling various tools.
5. **Evaluation:** The Agent evaluates the results of the action.
6. **Loop:** Based on the evaluation, the Agent adjusts and continues the loop until the goal is achieved.

This is similar to how a human developer works: understanding requirements → making a plan → writing code → testing → fixing bugs → iterating.

## 3. How to Write Good Prompts

In Vibe Coding, the quality of prompts directly determines the quality of AI output. Here are some practical prompt writing tips:

### 3.1 Basic Principles

1. **Be Specific:** Clearly describe what you want to achieve, avoiding vague expressions.
   - ❌ "Make a website"
   - ✅ "Make a personal blog with a header, article list, and comment section"

2. **Provide Context:** Give the AI enough background information so it can generate more relevant code.
   - ❌ "Write a login function"
   - ✅ "Write a login function using JWT, storing tokens in localStorage, with a 7-day expiration"

3. **Define Constraints:** Specify technical requirements and limitations.
   - ❌ "Write an API"
   - ✅ "Write a RESTful API using Express.js, following REST conventions, returning JSON data"

4. **Iterative Refinement:** Start with simple requirements, then gradually add complexity.

### 3.2 Prompt Structure Template

A good prompt can follow this structure:

```
[Role/Context] + [Task Description] + [Technical Requirements] + [Expected Output]

Example:
"As a full-stack developer, create a user registration API using Node.js + Express + MongoDB. 
The API should validate email format, hash passwords with bcrypt, and return JWT tokens. 
Provide complete code with error handling and comments."
```

### 3.3 Common Prompt Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Step-by-Step** | Ask AI to break down complex tasks | "First create the database schema, then write the API, finally build the frontend" |
| **Example-Based** | Provide examples for reference | "Similar to the login page on https://example.com, create a registration page" |
| **Role-Playing** | Assign a specific role | "As a senior frontend engineer, review this React code and point out performance issues" |
| **Constraint-Based** | Emphasize constraints | "Use only vanilla JavaScript, no external libraries" |

## 4. Hands-On: Building a Snake Game

Now let's put it into practice! We'll build a Snake game with AI poem generation functionality using Vibe Coding.

### 4.1 Project Requirements

**Core Features:**
1. Classic Snake gameplay—control the snake to eat food, avoid hitting walls or itself
2. Word collection—when the snake moves, it collects English words appearing on the board
3. AI poem generation—select collected words to generate poems using DeepSeek API
4. Data persistence—word collections persist across multiple rounds

**Technical Requirements:**
- Frontend: HTML5 Canvas game rendering
- Backend: API service integrated with DeepSeek
- State Management: Save word inventory across game sessions

### 4.2 Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Describe the Project

First, describe your project goal to the AI Agent:

> "Create a Snake game web application with the following features:
> 1. Classic Snake gameplay with keyboard controls
> 2. Word collection: words appear randomly on the board, snake collects them by eating
> 3. Word inventory: collected words are displayed in a sidebar
> 4. AI poetry generation: select words and click 'Generate Poem' to call DeepSeek API and generate a poem
> 5. Word persistence: used words are removed or decreased from the inventory
> 6. Navigation: simple tabs or top menu to switch between two pages
> 7. Shared state: ensure collected words stay synchronized and visible on both pages"

#### Step 2: AI Generates Code

The AI Agent will analyze your requirements and generate the initial code structure:

- Backend: Express.js server, DeepSeek API integration
- Frontend: HTML5 Canvas game, word inventory management
- Database: Simple in-memory or file-based storage

#### Step 3: Test and Iterate

Run the code and check if it meets expectations:

- Does the game work correctly?
- Does word collection function properly?
- Does the AI poetry generation work?
- Are there any bugs or issues?

If problems arise, continue refining through conversation:

> "The snake moves too slowly, please increase the speed"
> "The word inventory isn't displaying correctly, please check the state management"
> "The API call failed, please add error handling"

### 4.3 Key Technical Points

During development, pay attention to these points:

1. **Game Loop:** Use `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth rendering
2. **Collision Detection:** Check if the snake head overlaps with food, walls, or itself
3. **State Management:** Ensure word inventory is synchronized between game page and poetry page
4. **API Security:** Store API keys in `.env` files, add to `.gitignore` to prevent leakage
5. **Error Handling:** Add try-catch blocks for API calls, provide user-friendly error messages

### 4.4 Running the Project

**Frontend:**
```bash
# If using a simple static file
open index.html

# If using a development server
npm run dev
```

**Backend:**
```bash
npm install
# Set your DeepSeek API key in .env
echo "DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_api_key" > .env
npm start
```

- **Display the same shared word inventory.**
- **User selects some words and clicks **Generate Poem** button.**
- **Send these words to the backend, where DeepSeek API generates a poem.**
- **After generating the poem, used words are removed or decreased from the inventory.**
- **Navigation:** Simple tab or top menu to switch between the two pages.
- **Shared State:** Ensure collected words stay synchronized and visible on both pages.

- **Example Results**

# 5. AI Agent Platform Comparison (Choosing the Best Combination for Simple Projects)

Different Vibe Coding platforms each have their own characteristics and workflows. We tested multiple platforms using the same "Snake game with DeepSeek API" requirements, evaluating their strengths and weaknesses from a beginner's perspective. Here's the summary.

## 1. Comparison Criteria

1. **Goal**
   Build a Snake (Snake) web application integrated with DeepSeek API.

2. **Game Details**
   1. The game generates poetry through DeepSeek LLM API.
   2. The snake eats English words; collected words are retained after the game ends and continue to be used in new rounds. The same word can be collected multiple times and counted separately.
   3. When a poem is generated, used words are removed from the inventory.

3. **Must-Haves**
   1. A runnable frontend page containing the Snake game (keyboard control, Canvas rendering).
   2. Word collection mechanism (words appear on the board, sidebar list updates when snake eats a word).
   3. Persistence of word inventory across multiple game rounds.
   4. Backend using DeepSeek API (if no API Key, can return mock poetry first).
   5. "Generate Poetry" button: clicks to call backend, displays poetry, and updates word inventory based on usage.
   6. Support for `.env` API Key, and avoiding key leakage through `.gitignore`.

4. **Nice-to-Haves**
   1. Users can select which words to use for generating poetry.
   2. Good user experience (e.g., clear sidebar showing word list, well-laid-out poetry display area).
   3. Add comments in the code for beginners, explaining key logic.
